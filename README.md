            This repo is a comprehensive repository designed to help users quickly and effectively get started with Unity's multiplayer solutions using Facepunch as the transport layer and Unity's Netcode For GameObjects framework.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Before you begin

Netcode supports the following versions:

* Unity 2021.3 and later
* Mono and IL2CPP Scripting Backends

Netcode supports the following platforms:

* Windows, macOS, and Linux
* iOS and Android
* XR platforms running on Windows, Android, and iOS operating systems

You can read more about **Unity Multiplayer Networking** docs [here](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/).

## ‚öíÔ∏è How to Install

If you haven't install Unity Netcode For GameObjects, then do so via this [link](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/installation/install).

Then install [Facepunch Transport](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/multiplayer-community-contributions/tree/main/Transports/com.community.netcode.transport.facepunch) layer.

Or copy this git command and paste in Package Manager:

```console
https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/multiplayer-community-contributions.git?path=/Transports/com.community.netcode.transport.facepunch
```

Then you have [wiki page](https://wiki.facepunch.com/steamworks/) for API and more documentation code.

## üìù How To Use It

You need to assign SteamId to FacepunchTransport

```csharp
private void HandleTransport(SteamId id)
{
    // Lorem Ipsum
    NetworkManager.Singleton.GetComponent<FacepunchTransport>().targetSteamId = id;
}
```

By using callback from steam, you can send that information to FacepunchTransport
```csharp
private void Start()
{
    SteamFriends.OnGameLobbyJoinRequested += OnGameLobbyJoinRequested; // Add the callback
}

private void OnDestroy()
{
    SteamFriends.OnGameLobbyJoinRequested -= OnGameLobbyJoinRequested; // Remove the callback
}

private void OnGameLobbyJoinRequested(Lobby lobby, SteamId id)
{
    HandleTransport(id);
}
```

After you got the callbacks and also changing `targetSteamId` in `FacepunchTransport`, is pretty much the same stuff with Unity Netcode For GameObjects.
